# Prerequisites

## Install Git

Follow [the instructions](https://git-scm.com/downloads) from the official git website.

## Install IntelliJ

For a better experience I recommend you have installed latest version or `IntelliJ Community Edition` or `IntelliJ Ultimate Edition` from `Jetbrains Toolbox`.

To do so, you can download `Jetbrains Toolbox` [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

When it is installed, open `Jetbrains Toolbox` and choose the version of `IntelliJ Idea` you want to install.

Usually, you can choose the following:

- `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition` (free and open source)
- `IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate` (requires a licence)

## About previews and EAP

Jetbrains propose an [Early Access Program](https://www.jetbrains.com/resources/eap/) of the next versions of their IDEs. It allows anyone to take part of the last polishing by reporting bugs. Remember that those are not stable versions, and they can be removed at any moment.

Sometimes, you can try such a preview version (which is free and does not require a licence). 

To do so, in `Jetbrains Toolbox`, on the `Tools` tab in front of an IDE name (ex. `IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate`) look for a button with 3 vertical dots (usually right to the `Update` or `Install` button). Click on it a then click on `Other Versions` or `Available Versions`.

If there is a choice that mentions `EAP` or `preview`, it is very likely to be free. 

At last, I recommend that you choose `English` as IDE language from `Jetbrains Toolbox Settings`. This way, you won't have to bother to translate the instructors instructions.

## Installing Java

In this Yoga session, you don't need to install Java beforehand. The yoga session will guide you to do so.

## About VPN and proxies

In this yoga session, I assume that you have unrestricted access to internet and full control of your computer. 

If you want to practice it in a corporate environment, I recommend you check with you system administrator of that you use your personal device and connect to an unrestricted internet access.
