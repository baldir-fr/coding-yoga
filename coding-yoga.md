# Coding Yoga

This is coding Yoga.

I will guide you through some moves with `Java 17`, `git` and `IntelliJ`.

Before you continue, please make sure you check [the few prerequisites](prerequisites.md) for this yoga session.

At this point, I assume you have `git` installed and an up-to-date version of `IntelliJ` (either `Community Edition` or `Ultimate Edition`) installed

Now, you can begin to relax and just follow my steps.

## 01 - Travel in time

```shell
git checkout 01-travel-in-time
```

For the instructions I will give you, there often a lot of different ways to do so.
It can be mouse moves, keyboard moves, shortcuts, live templates and so on. At the beginning of this session, I will give you only one way to do the basic moves. If you already know a different way to do it more efficiently, feel free to use it!

Also, you may have remarked the `git checkout 01-travel-in-time` snippet at the beginning of this chapter. Each new chapter will have a `git tag` that is a save point. This will allow to “travel in time” with `git`.

For the next step, please checkout the following `git tag`.

```shell
git checkout 02-create-a-file
```
