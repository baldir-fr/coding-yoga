# Coding Yoga

This is coding Yoga.

I will guide you through some moves with `Java 17`, `git` and `IntelliJ`.

Before you continue, please make sure you check [the few prerequisites](prerequisites.md) for this yoga session.

At this point, I assume you have `git` installed and an up-to-date version of `IntelliJ` (either `Community Edition` or `Ultimate Edition`) installed

Now, you can begin to relax and just follow my steps.
